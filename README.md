# The Discovery of Handwashing

In 1847, the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis made a breakthough discovery: he discovers handwashing. Contaminated hands was a major cause of childbed fever and by enforcing handwashing at his hospital he saved hundreds of lives. 

In this project I analyze the data that Semmelweis collected and offer the necessary data backed insights and evidence  Semmelweis would have needed to convice the medical community sooner
